## Installation

- To use the Emergency Simulator, a device functioning as server and local area connection between devices is required. One possibility to build up such an environment is e.g. to use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> in combination with a wlan hotspot.
- When the codebase is downloaded, the initial name of the archive is ```SIMLab-Emergency-Simulator-master.zip```. It is *highly* recommended to rename the unzipped folder to **esim**.
- When using XAMPP, the previously downloaded folder (now named **esim**) needs to be placed in *htdocs*. (*htdocs* is a subfolder in the XAMPP installation directly, e.g. ```C:/xampp```
  - If another name e.g. *my_name* is chosen as foldername instead of *esim*, the app can be accessed using the ```server_ip_adress/my_name/```. 
- A *modern* internet browser is required to run the application.
  - If the browser is to old to run the app, a popup will notify the user at ```login.html```.

## FAQ

- **Why are all the dependencies included in the project?**
    - The Emergency Simulator was ment be able to work without a stable internet connection. 
    Therefore, with e.g. the use of a low cost wifi-hotspot, trainings with two connected devices
    can be perfomed.
- **How to find out the IP adress of my server?**
    - The method to find the current IP adress is depending on the operating system of the server. 
      - If windows is used, the IP Adress can be found using the *command line* and issuing the command *ipconfig*. Then look for the entry: *IP Adress*.
      - For macOS, use the *Terminal* and type *ifconfig | grep "inet "*. 
      - For other operating systems, refer to external sources.

## Contributions

In this section, a lot of potential improvements are hinted at. If you want to contribute to this repository and project, feel free to fork or clone.

### Potential Changes and Features for Future Versions

Many of the already implemented features are listed on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kEWTkjUGEv1Msgwj1EuNwlg2URnYAXst4ZItrPl_gXs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> GoogleSpreadsheet</a>. However, there are more general ideas to further improve the Application and the Codebase: 

#### Application Features
- Implement the calculation and visualization of the 12 channel ECG.
- Improve taining-documentation of parameter changes and trainee reactions and improve the PDF export of the data.

#### Code Adaptions
- Perform code quality improvements (e.g. ESLint)
- Implement all "TODO"'s which are marked throughout the code.
- Save screenshots in the database instead of the folder structure on the server.
- Improve HTML parts in terms of:
  - Extended Comments for readability;
  - (More) CSS classes instead of styles.
- Move from myQSL to e.g. ReThinkDB, as most persistently saved stuff is already saved as json strings.
- Use Node.js as Backend-Solution instead of PHP.
- Evaluate TypeScript as alternative to JS.
