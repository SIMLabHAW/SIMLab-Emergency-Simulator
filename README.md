## Want to use the App?
You are interested in learning about this product without wrapping your head around the sourcecode? - Head over to our [Wiki-Page](https://github.com/SIMLabHAW/SIMLab-Emergency-Simulator/wiki), where we tell you all about the project background, its features and how to install the Emergency Simulator in all detail. 

If terms like *IP address*, *localhost* or *XAMPP* sound familiar, continue with the installation process here.

### Alternative for Android: ReSimulate
If you are not motivated to install the App on your server, ReSimulate might be an interesting alternative:
Based on the idea of this webapp, a free Android App was recently published (August 2019), which does not require a server connection but instead connects two devices via Wifi/Bluetooth. If you are interested, head over to [ReSimulate](https://www.resimulate.de/en) to test and use the App for free.

## Quick Installation Guide

- To use the Emergency Simulator, a device functioning as server and local area connection between devices is required. One possibility to build up such an environment is e.g. to use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> in combination with a wlan hotspot.
- When the codebase is downloaded, the initial name of the archive is ```SIMLab-Emergency-Simulator-master.zip```. It is *highly* recommended to rename the unzipped folder to **esim**.
- When using XAMPP, the previously downloaded folder (now named **esim**) needs to be placed in *htdocs*. (*htdocs* is a subfolder in the XAMPP installation directly, e.g. ```C:/xampp```
  - If another name e.g. *my_name* is chosen as foldername instead of *esim*, the app can be accessed using the ```server_ip_adress/my_name/```. 
- A *modern* internet browser is required to run the application.
  - If the browser is to old to run the app, a popup will notify the user at ```login.html```.

## FAQ

- **Why are all the dependencies included in the project?**
    - The Emergency Simulator was ment be able to work without a stable internet connection. 
    Therefore, with e.g. the use of a low cost wifi-hotspot, trainings with two connected devices
    can be perfomed.
- **How to find out the IP adress of my server?**
    - When using Firefox or Google Chrome as a Browser, the local IP address is shown on *login.html*.
    - The method to find the current IP adress is depending on the operating system of the server. 
      - If windows is used, the IP Adress can be found using the *command line* and issuing the command *ipconfig*. Then look for the entry: *IP Adress*.
      - For macOS, use the *Terminal* and type *ifconfig | grep "inet "*. 
      - For other operating systems, refer to external sources.
